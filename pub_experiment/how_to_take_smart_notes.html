<h1>Reading "How To Take Smart Notes" by Sönke Ahrens</h1>
<hr class="full-sep" />
<h2>The idea</h2>
<hr class="full-sep" />
<p>From Introduction, Chapter 1, page 3</p>
<blockquote>To sum it up: The quality of the paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done writing before you even made a decision on the topic.</blockquote>
<p>The above uses writing a paper as an example, but perhaps the same works in a general sense: taking smart notes is direct work towards development of ideas: papers, articles, books, etc.</p>
<p id="ref1">Examples of good notes given fall in two categories: bibliographic references and own ideas inspired by reading other material. They are to be written on separate pages that can be linked with a numeric system of references such that they can be tied together into chains of thought. This is what is known as the slip-box, or <em>Zettelkasten</em><span class="fn-wrap"><a class="fn-ref" href="#fn1">[1]</a></span> in German.</p>
<p id="ref2">The book later quotes a passage from The Oxford Handbook of Neurothics<span class="fn-wrap"><a class="fn-ref" href="#fn2">[2]</a></span>, which characterizes the act of writing as neccessary for serious work:</p>
<blockquote>Notes on paper, or on computer screen [...] do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it possible.</blockquote>
<p>Another quote from the same source underlines the importance of having an external workflow to supplement the mind:</p>
<blockquote>no matter how internal processes are implemented, (you) need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding.</blockquote>
<p>It is important to externalise your ideas. It's more than just saving it for later; putting things into written word requires reflection and a deeper understanding of the topic.</p>
<p>Following the conclusion that writing is a neccessary part of intellectual effort, the author suggests adopting the slip-box - a note-taking system that builds up resources for your own future work.</p>
<blockquote>Thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas is the main work of everyone who studies, does research or writes. If you write to improve all of these activities, you have a strong tailwind going for you. If you take your notes in a smart way, it will propel you forward.</blockquote>
<h2>On not forcing work when it doesn't feel right</h2>
<hr class="full-sep" />
<p>From Introduction, Chapter 1, page 5</p>
<blockquote>Until now, writing and note-taking techniques were usually taught without much regard to the overarching workflow. This book aims to change that. It will present you with the tools of note-taking that turned the son of a brewer into one of the most productive and revered social scientists of the 20th century. But moreover, it describes how he implmenented them into his workflow so he could honestly say:<strong>"I never force myself to do anything I don't feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else."</strong> A good structure allows you to do that, to move seamlessly from one task to another - without threatening the whole arrangemenet or losing sight of the bigger picture."</blockquote>
<p id="ref3">Emphasis mine; the bolded sentence rings similar to my own observations on the topic of finding will to pick up creative work, and sticking with it over time.<span class="fn-wrap"><a class="fn-ref" href="#fn3">[3]</a></span></p>
<h2>Workflow as an alternative to planning</h2>
<hr class="full-sep" />
<p>From introduction, Chapter 1, page 6</p>
<blockquote>Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement - which we ideally have on a regular basis and just as an exception. Even though planning is often at odds with the very idea of research and learning, it is the mantra of most study guides and self-help books on academic writing. How do you plan for insight, which, by definition, cannot be anticipated? It is a huge misunderstanding that the only alternative to planning is aimless messing around. The challenge is to structure one's workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward. We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery - or insight.</blockquote>
<p id="ref4">I can relate to this quote from a perspective of a game developer - a similar thing is often said about play. Book Rules of Play <span class="fn-wrap"><a class="fn-ref" href="#fn4">[4]</a></span> notes the difficulty of predicting play when arguing for iterative approach to game design. I often preach the benefits of iterating, based on my experience and intuition. Perhaps the argument could be strengthened if I think about it through the lens of a workflow as seen in this book.</p>
