<h1>Zeigarnik effect</h1>
<hr class="full-sep" />
<p id="ref1">Summary from the Wikipedia article:<span class="fn-wrap"><a class="fn-ref" href="#fn1">[1]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>In psychology, the Zeigarnik effect, named after Lithuanian-Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, occurs when an activity that has been interrupted may be more readily recalled. It postulates that people remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks. In Gestalt psychology, the Zeigarnik effect has been used to demonstrate the general presence of Gestalt phenomena: not just appearing as perceptual effects, but also present in cognition.</blockquote>
<p>The article quotes an observation about a waiter taking and remembering orders as an inspiration to study this phenomenon. It stuck with me and is a good example to give when explaining the effect to other people.</p>
<p id="ref2">This effect is similar to but distinct from the Ovsiankina effect<span class="fn-wrap"><a class="fn-ref" href="#fn2">[2]</a></span>, characterized as an urge to complete tasks previously initiated.</p>
<blockquote>Maria Ovsiankina, a colleague of Zeigarnik, investigated the effect of task interruption on the tendency to resume the task at the next opportunity.</blockquote>
<h2>On Finished and Unfinished Tasks</h2>

<p>Bullet point summary of the findings:</p>
<ol><li>Interrupted tasks are better recalled than completed ones.</li><li>A task being undertaken creates a tension. It remains within a person until the assignment is done.</li><li>Whether something is complete or not depends on the person's own perception.</li></ol>
<h3>Notes from the read-through</h3>
<p id="ref4">I originally picked up this paper to learn about how this effect is used by apps and social media to compel user behavior.<span class="fn-wrap"><a class="fn-ref" href="#fn4">[4]</a></span> Just a few paragraphs in I found myself relating this to my day-to-day instead. Both at work and doing my hobbies at home I am faced with all kinds of interruptions - meetings, incoming messages, dependencies on other people; even technology conspires against my focus by serving loading bars that often take minutes to hours while blocking my workspace.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, I would like to always focus on one manageable task at a time, ideally in a string of logical steps towards a goal. The reality of my work makes it impossible. Along the way there will always be numerous responsibilities to keep track of and many distractions to deal with. Not all of them necessarily bad - sometimes you have to take care of things.</p>
<p>This is where I think it's interesting to take a look at this effect. Since interruptions are inevitable, it should be useful to understand what happens to the brain as its trying to deal with unfinished tasks every day.</p>
<p>#### Finished and unfinished tasks in iterative work</p>
<p id="ref5">Many of the tasks I do are a part of a larger iterative process.<span class="fn-wrap"><a class="fn-ref" href="#fn5">[5]</a></span><span class="fn-wrap"><a class="fn-ref" href="#fn6">[6]</a></span> This consists of building small working chunks of a bigger whole and trying things early. Prototypes, naive versions and demakes are common artifacts that I make quickly and playtest on my own or with a group of people to gather feedback and correct course, before starting progress on the next increment.</p>
<blockquote>Careful study of the tasks themselves reveals that the per cent of recall varies not so much with what an onlooker might consider "finished" or "unfinished" but rather with the subject's own feeling. The subject may seem to have finished a task but may himself consider the result inadequate and the task far from completed and vice versa. Comparing the introspective reports with other data collected from such a subject one finds that tasks of this sort often enjoy as much advantage in memory as those actually interrupted by the experimenter.</blockquote>
<p>Is it possible that this way of organizing tasks allows one to experience the satisfaction of getting things done[iterative way,</p>
<p>The quote above continues with the following remark that is relevant to this:</p>
<blockquote>As regards tasks with clear-cut goals and those that could conceivably go on indefinitely, a decided difference in result was found. Interruption of the latter plays a far weaker role in the matter of tension and memory than when the former are interrupted. Example: if the task is one of marking X's on a sheet of paper this is presumably an endless undertaking and therefore interruption means not so much leaving the task unfinished as merely calling a halt. Hence there was no marked difference in memory advantage in this kind of task.</blockquote>
<p>From this follows that iterative work might doubly benefit from clear, well defined goals, beyond the common sense reasons. It might not only be important to make meaningful progress with each step, but also to regularly contextualize recent work in terms of progress towards completion. Each iteration should end with a plan for the next one. Add new todos to the existing pile and re-prioritize. (</p>
<blockquote>The recall advantage enjoyed by unfinished tasks with these subjects was 175 per cent as against the general average of 90. It appears that although mere intention gave no particular impetus for recall, the extent to which a subject was immersed in his work did make a decided difference.</blockquote>
<p>Something to think about when discussing obstacles in professional workflows of large orniazations. Unwieldy technology and coordination snags can create an environment that is hostile to immersion and flow. While this study focuses on recall, I wonder if there are other cognitive advantages we give up in the long term when we allow work to become frustrating.</p>
<p>#### Factors negatively affecting the strength of the effect</p>
<blockquote>Fatigue. It was found in the course of these experiments that with fatigued subjects memorial advantage lay on the side not of the unfinished but of the completed tasks.</blockquote>
<p>This makes sense empirically. When tired I want to stop working and rest - any tension towards completing tasks should be weaker.</p>
<blockquote>To test the influence exerted by an interval of time between performance and recall, certain groups of subjects were not questioned until the following day. The memorial advantage of unfinished tasks declined in these cases to a bare 14 per cent. Nevertheless diminution of tension is not due to time as such, but depends rather upon the significant events which take place during the interval.</blockquote>
<p>Several tests were conducted to test this hypothesis. The results showed that events that make it harder to resume tasks resulted in worse recall. In one example the subjects were interrupted with an important expected phonecall that ended with an unexpected joke. In another a casual discussion about some recent book was introduced between the last task and the recall. Both resulted in worse recall of unfinished tasks, but the reduction was steeper in the first(more disruptive) example.</p>
<blockquote>Repressed tasks. It often occurred that a subject would be given a task which he "could not do". He felt that the task was beyond his capacity. Should this task be interrupted, such a subject frequently assumed that the experimenter had detected his "inferiority" and had withdrawn the task for that reason. Such tasks were usually forgotten when the report was made.</blockquote>
<p>This again makes me want to reflect on frustration sources in professional work. In the framing of this study, it would appear the mind might strive to disqualify some tasks altogether if the friction is too great, or perhaps if the interruption becomes associated with failure and a feeling of inadequacy.</p>
