<h1>Circle of Boredom</h1>
<hr class="full-sep" />
<p>Jotting down some associacions to develop into a note later:</p>
<ol><li id="ref1">Power of surprise and novelty<span class="fn-wrap"><a class="fn-ref" href="#fn1">[1]</a></span></li><li>How I make decisions throughout the day; what makes me get up or start an action</li><li id="ref2">Good structure makes it easy to change focus when tired or frustrated, then come back to it later. The idea is features in Zettelkasten<span class="fn-wrap"><a class="fn-ref" href="#fn2">[2]</a></span> and the book How To Take Smart Notes<span class="fn-wrap"><a class="fn-ref" href="#fn3">[3]</a></span>.</li><li>Attention span and impulses. Sometimes sitting down with a book you immediately get the urge to stand back up again and apply some idea you just read to your own experience, or even put it into some action. Might be worth researching - this note was first written directly following such a moment.</li><li>What happens to your brain when you read a book. Something to research in relation to 4.</li><li>Social media related activities are all usually easy to pick up and hard to put down. You never really get bored scrolling an infinite reel of algorithmically selected videos. Something to dwell upon.</li><li>Can you learn to get bored with social media?</li></ol>
<h2>Zeigarnik effect</h2>
<hr class="full-sep" />
<p id="ref4">A study conducted by Bluma Zeigarnik observed that unresolved tasks enjoy a memory advantage over completed ones.<span class="fn-wrap"><a class="fn-ref" href="#fn4">[4]</a></span> This effect has been put to use in various interfaces across social media, utilizing this tension to compel attention and engagement from users.<span class="fn-wrap"><a class="fn-ref" href="#fn5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p>This is some scientific backing for a couple of ideas I want to write about here.</p>
<ol><li id="ref6">Swap freely between a small number of activities while retaining good memory of progress for each. When backed by a reliable workflow<span class="fn-wrap"><a class="fn-ref" href="#fn6">[6]</a></span> it might even be beneficial for productivity.</li><li>Better retain reading material by taking breaks to take notes, talk it over with peers. This could also work with relaxing activities with low cognitive load - going on a walk, listening to music, meditation, maybe even playing a grindy mmo. One concern to consider is that prolonged tension from multiple unfinished tasks could potentially be a source of stress.</li></ol>
